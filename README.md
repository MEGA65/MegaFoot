# MegaFoot
An attempt by the MEGA65 community to write a modest 80's fighter game with BASIC 65 + Eleven

## A Community-driven game
Main hope was that the MEGA65 community can help drive the development of this game.
So whether you'd like to contribute some art, graphics or coding into the mix, you're
more than welcome to open a PR (Pull Request) with your contributions.

Also worth talking through things with us on the MEGA65 Discord server (https://mega65.org/chat),
so that we can all stay on the same page with it.

## Giving credit
As we want to assure that all contributors get the credit they deserve, will aim to do the following things:
- when it's done, will assure that the filehost upload of the final game will be the `MEGA65` account (i.e., won't be uploaded under anyone's personal filehost account)
- contributors can be credited within the filehost description, in game and in source.
- If it were to feature in any future intro-disk, for its entry details, we can say the author is 'MEGA65 Community', and then list the contributors within the description section
