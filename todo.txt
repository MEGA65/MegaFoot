gameplay mechanics:
------------------
- make clouds move independently
- make sun set slowly over time
IN PROGRESS- jumps
DONE- sequence multiple opponent challenges as the player progresses
- allow players/baddies to change clothing colour
- player must release prior attack move before triggering it again
- reconsider joystick movement to trigger each move
  (current choices aren't ideal)

DONE- music
  DONE- better filter controls during song
  DONE- save out filter presets and choices to file
  DONE- save out chunk order to file
DONE- reverse joystick attack direction if player direction has changed
DONE- sound effects
DONE- optimise 'grab' data to minimise memory use
  (and make room for baddie frames)
DONE- add female player option
  (for my daughter to 'connect' with this game better :))
DONE- add baddie (with some dumb ai)
DONE- devise some scrolling logic (when to scroll, when not to)
DONE- bounding box collision checks
DONE- energy bars
DONE- joystick support
DONE- add in deft's player/baddie head art variations

2024 Goals
----------
- port Eleven's '11.parse' completely to Rust
- story line cut scenes
- add big baddie for final fight
- more attack moves?
- make use of duck sprite in some way
  (perhaps if player is hit by some magic, they turn into a duck for a minute)

title screen:
------------
- Ponder new name for game (Mega Fu / WOTIF / Exploding Fish)
- think of splashy title screen ideas to showcase BASIC 65 performance

intro:
-----
- scrolly text intro
- offer selection of main character (male or female)

Housekeeping todo:
-----------------
DONE- split layers and player frames apart
  (so that in future, people can add new layers, or player frames more comfortably)
DONE- make new players/enemy characters
  (so that player can have one of multiple heads. E.g. deft's new ones)
DONE- deft's art is here:
    - https://discord.com/channels/719326990221574164/805252939593416705/1164133584941097060
DONE- update 'grabber' tool to:
  DONE- add/edit existing frames
  DONE- define hit boxes
  DONE- load/save hitboxes
  DONE- repair last remnants of $42000 access
DONE- update code to load up newly structured layers + player-frames + hit-boxes
